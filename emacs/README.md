My Emacs

## Key Bindings

These are just keybindings I want to try and remember.

    C-c r   org-remember   Remember something into a specific journal
    C-x C-j C-c jabber-connect

## Stuff To Figure Out

- Figure out a good way to read email in Emacs. Wanderlust was okay, GNUS was okay, but neither works well with Inbox.
